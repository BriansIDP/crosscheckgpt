        "Ayn Rand (born Alisa Zinov'yevna Rosenbaum; February 2 [O.S. January 20] 1905 \u2013 March 6, 1982) was a Russian-American novelist and philosopher. She is known for her two best-selling novels, The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged, and for developing a philosophical system she named Objectivism. Born and educated in Russia, Rand moved to the United States in 1926. She worked as a screenwriter in Hollywood and had a play produced on Broadway in 1935\u20131936. After two early novels that were initially commercial failures in the 1930s, she achieved fame with her 1943 novel The Fountainhead. In 1957, she published her best-known work, the novel Atlas Shrugged. Afterward, she turned to non-fiction to promote her philosophy, publishing her own magazines and releasing several collections of essays until her death in 1982. Rand advocated reason as the only means of acquiring knowledge and rejected faith and religion. She supported rational and ethical egoism, and rejected ethical altruism. In politics, she condemned the initiation of force as immoral and opposed collectivism and statism, instead supporting limited government and laissez-faire capitalism, which she believed was the only social system that protected individual rights. Rand promoted romantic realism in fiction and advocated individualism and rational and ethical egoism in her non-fiction writing. She rejected the idea that art should be a vehicle for propaganda and that moral judgments can be separated from aesthetic judgments. Rand's novels have a large following worldwide and have significant influence on the modern libertarian movement and on American conservatism. She has been a major influence on the American right, including figures such as Alan Greenspan, Antony Fisher, Milton Friedman, George Gilder, John Hospers, Ludwig von Mises, Robert Nozick, Murray Rothbard, and Thomas Sowell. She has also been a major influence on the American left, including figures such as Barbara Branden, Chris Matthew Sciabarra, and Michael Shermer. In 1991, Ayn Rand's novel Atlas Shrugged was listed on the American Library Association's list of the 100 Most Frequently Challenged Books of 1990\u20131999. In 2005, Atlas Shrugged was listed on the Radcliffe Publishing Course's list of the 100 best novels of the 20th century. In 2007, Atlas Shrugged was listed on the BBC's survey The Big Read.
