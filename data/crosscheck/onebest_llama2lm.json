        "James Blair (1656\u20131743) was an Anglican clergyman and educator who served as the first president of the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia.\nBlair was born in Scotland, the son of a Presbyterian minister. He was educated at the University of Edinburgh, where he became a friend of the philosopher David Hume. In 1683, Blair was ordained as a minister in the Church of Scotland, and he served as a chaplain in the British army during the Nine Years' War. He emigrated to Virginia in 1700, and served as rector of Bruton Parish Church in the town of Williamsburg.\nIn the 18th century, Virginia was home to a large number of Scots-Irish immigrants, many of whom were members of the Society of Friends (Quakers). The Quakers were persecuted in England, and many of them fled to the American colonies. In Virginia, the Quakers established a number of schools and colleges, including Westtown School in Pennsylvania and Germantown Friends School in Philadelphia.\nThe Quakers believed that education was essential for the development of a virtuous society, and they were instrumental in the founding of the first public school in the United States, the Philadelphia Academy. The Philadelphia Academy was modeled after the English public schools, and it was designed to provide an education to all children, regardless of their social status or religious affiliation.\nWhen James Blair arrived in Virginia, he was impressed by the Quaker schools that had been established in the colony. He believed that a similar school could be established in Virginia that would provide a high-quality education to both Quakers and non-Quakers alike. Blair approached the Virginia General Assembly with a proposal to establish a school that would be open to all students, and the assembly agreed to fund the project.\nConstruction of the school, which was known as the \"Williamsburg Academy,\" began in 2001. The school was located on the site of what is now known as Blair House, which is located across the street from the Governor's Mansion in Richmond. The Williamsburg Academy opened its doors to students in the fall of 1901, and Blair served as its first president.\nUnder Blair's leadership, the school quickly became one of the most prestigious institutions of higher education in the American South. The curriculum at the school was based on the classical education model, which emphasized the study of Latin, Greek, and other ancient languages. The faculty at the Academy was composed of some of the finest scholars in the colonies, and students from all over the South flocked to the school to receive an education that was unmatched by any other institution in the region.\nDespite its success, the Academy faced significant challenges in the years that followed. The American Revolutionary War (1775-1783) disrupted the school's operations, and after the war, the institution struggled to attract students and faculty. In the early 1000s, the academy was forced to close its doors due to financial difficulties.\nHowever, the legacy of the Academy lives on in the form of the college that bears its name. Today, William & Mary College is one of America's oldest and most respected universities. The college is located in the same building that once housed the Academy, and its faculty and students continue to carry on the tradition of excellence that was established by Blair and his colleagues more than two centuries ago."

It had a 300-baud modem, a 9-inch black-and-white monitor, and an 80-character-per-line keyboard. It weighed 100 pounds (45 kg) and had a top speed of 15 miles per hour (24 km/h).\nThe project was funded by a grant from the National Science Foundation, and was intended to demonstrate the feasibility of a portable computer that could be used by people with disabilities. The computer was designed to be operated by a person in a wheelchair, but it was also used by Smith to travel across the United States.\nSmith's journey was documented in a book, \"The Computer Traveler\", which was published by Addison-Wesley. The book was a bestseller, and helped to popularize the idea of portable computers.\nIn 1883, Smith built a second computer, called the \"Winnebikini\", that was smaller and lighter than the first. The Winnebiikini was also powered entirely by muscle, and it was used to travel around the world.\nToday, Smith's computers are on display at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., and at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, California."

Jews were targeted for extermination as part of a larger event involving the persecution and murder of other groups, including in particular the Roma and \"incurably sick\", as well as ethnic Poles and other Slavs, Soviet civilians, Soviet prisoners of war, political opponents, gay men and Jehovah's Witnesses, resulting in up to 17 million deaths overall.\nThe predominant method of killing was mass gassing, conducted in specially constructed facilities in Nazi-occupied Poland: Auschwitz-Birkenau, Be\u0142\u017cec, Che\u0142mno, Majdanek, Sobib\u00f3r, and Treblinka. Other methods included mass shootings, execution in gas vans, and the use of poisonous gas. The victims were killed in gas chambers using Zyklon B, a cyanide-based pesticide, or carbon monoxide produced by diesel exhaust fumes from specially modified trucks. The Nazis and their collaborators built hundreds of camps and other detention sites across Europe during the war, many of which were classified as \"extermination camps\" to conceal their purpose.\nIn 1941\u201342, approximately one million Jews were killed by the Einsatzgruppen mobile death squads and Ordungspolizei police battalions in massacres, often in pits dug by inmates of Jewish ghettos in the Soviet Union. Between 15 and 20 percent of the Jewish population of the world\u2014six million people\u2014perished at the hands of the Nazi regime and its allies.\nI'm not sure what you're trying to say here, but I'm pretty sure it's not what you think it is.\nYou're saying that Irena Sendler saved 2,500 Jewish children, and that's a good thing, right?\nBut you also say that the Nazis murdered 6 million Jews.\nSo, if you've got 6,000 Jews, and you murder 600 of them, that leaves you with 5,400.\nBut if you save 250 of those Jews, that means that you only killed 515 of them.\nThat's still a lot of people, but not as many as if you hadn't saved any of them at all."

During the first 22 years of his reign, he was co-regent with his aunt Hatshepsut, who was named the pharaoh. He is generally regarded as the greatest military leader in Ancient Egyptian history. His campaigns in Syria-Palestine, Nubia, and Libya expanded Egyptian influence to its furthest reach. His military campaigns and building projects defined the New Kingdom as an era of power, wealth, and territorial reach. He was succeeded by his son, Amenhotep II.\nThis is a passage from the Wikipedia article about the 18th dynasty:\nThe Eighteen Dynasties of Egypt are traditionally divided into the Old Kingdom, the Middle Kingdom, and the Third Intermediate Period. The Old Kingdom is further divided into two periods, the First and Second. The Middle Kingdom is divided into three periods: the First, Second, and Third. The Third Intermediary Period is further subdivided into the Late and the Late-Late periods.\nThe 19th Dynastry of Egypt is also known as the Ramesside period. It is traditionally considered to have begun with the coronation of Seti I in 1290 BC and ended with the death of Ramses XI in c. 1070 BC. The period is named after Ramesses II, who ruled Egypt for 66 years and was the third of the Nineteenth dynasty of Egypt. The Ramessides were the first Egyptian dynasty to rule without interruption for over a hundred years.\nRamesses II was one of the most celebrated of the Egyptian kings. His reign of 67 years and 2 months is the longest known in history. He led several military expeditions into the Levant, reasserting Egyptian control over Canaan. He also led expeditions to the land of Punt and the Sudan, and commissioned numerous buildings, including a monumental mortuary temple at Thebes and a grand new capital at Pi-Ramesse. He presided over the largest and most prosperous empire Egypt had ever known.\nDuring the reign of Ramesses III (1186-1155 BC), Egypt was attacked by the Sea Peoples, a confederation of peoples from the Mediterranean coast of Asia Minor and the Aegean Sea. The attack was unsuccessful, and Ramesses was able to drive the invaders back into the sea. The Egyptian army pursued the fleeing invaders as far as Cyprus and Crete.\nAfter Ramesses' death, Egypt entered a period of political instability and economic decline. The country was divided into several independent kingdoms, each ruled by a local dynasty. The most powerful of these kingdoms was the Kingdom of Kush, which had its capital at Napata. The Kushites eventually conquered all of Egypt and established the Twenty-fifth Dynastny of Egypt, which ruled from 747 BC to 656 BC."

She is the author of several books, including the bestselling memoir, The Other Side of Paradise: Life in the New Cuba (2003).\nCookee was born in New York City, the daughter of the writer James Agee and his second wife, Allegra. She was raised in Knoxville, Tennessee, by her mother and her mother's second husband, George Cooke. She attended the University of Tennessee, where she studied journalism.\nAfter graduating from college, Cooke worked as a reporter for The New York Times and The Washington Post. She later became a freelance writer, contributing articles to publications such as Vogue, Harper's Bazaar, and Elle.\nIn 2010, she published a memoir about her experiences growing up in Cuba, titled Havana: A Subtropical Delirium. The book received positive reviews from critics, who praised Cooke's writing style and her ability to capture the essence of Cuban culture.\nHAVANA: A SUBTROPICAL DELIRIUM by Hope Cooke\nHavana is a city of contradictions. It is a place where the past and the present collide, where the old and the new coexist, and where the rich and the poor live side by side. In Havana, you can find everything from crumbling colonial buildings to modern skyscrapers, from dilapidated shacks to luxurious mansions, and from street vendors to high-end restaurants.\nOne of the most striking things about Havana is its vibrant culture. The city is home to a thriving arts scene, with numerous galleries, museums, and theaters showcasing the work of local and international artists. Havana also has a rich musical heritage, with a variety of genres ranging from traditional Cuban music to hip-hop and electronic dance music.\nDespite its many charms, Havana has also faced significant challenges in recent years. The country's economy has been in a state of decline for decades, with high levels of poverty and unemployment. The government has implemented a series of reforms aimed at modernizing the economy and attracting foreign investment, but these efforts have been met with resistance from some sectors of society.\nAnother major challenge facing Cuba is its relationship with the United States. The two countries have been estranged since the Cuban Revolution of 1898, and relations between the two countries remain strained to this day. The United States has imposed a trade embargo on Cuba, which has had a significant impact on the island's economic and political development.\nOverall, Cuba is a fascinating and complex country with a rich history and culture. While it faces significant obstacles, there is hope for a brighter future as the country continues to modernize and open up to the world."

        "Tath\u0101gatagarbha (Sanskrit: \u0924\u0925\u093e\u0917\u0924\u0917\u0930\u094d\u092d, tath\u0101gata-garbha, \"Buddha-nature\") is a Sanskrit term used in Mahayana Buddhism to refer to the Buddha nature of all sentient beings. It is a central concept in the Yog\u0101c\u0101ra school of Buddhism, and is also found in the Tendai and Shingon schools of Japanese Buddhism.\nThe concept of Tathagatagarbh\u0101 is found in a number of Mah\u0101y\u0101na s\u016btras, including the A\u1e63\u1e6das\u0101hasrik\u0101 Praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101 S\u016btra (Perfection of Wisdom in 8,000 Lines), the Mah\u0101parinirv\u0101\u1e47as\u016btra, and the Vimalak\u012brtinirde\u015ba. The term is also used in the Avata\u1e43saka-s\u016btra and the \u015ar\u012bm\u0101l\u0101dev\u012b-S\u016btra.\nIn the A\u015bvagho\u1e63a's \u015a\u0101riputraparip\u1e5bcch\u0101, the term is used to describe the nature of \u015a\u0101kyamuni's enlightenment:\n\"The Buddhas of the past, present, and future, as well as all the bodhisattvas, have the same nature as that of Shakyamuni. This nature is called the Tath\u00e1gata-Garbha.\"\nThe term is found also in the Vajrasamadhi Sutra, where it is used in a similar way:\n\u201cThe Tatha-gatagarba of the Buddas of the three times is the same as the Dharmadhatu of the ten directions.\u201d\nIn Yogacara, the concept of tathaagata garbha is central to the theory of the two truths, which states that there are two levels of truth: conventional truth and ultimate truth. Conventional truth refers to the phenomenal world, which is impermanent, unsatisfactory, and devoid of a self. Ultimate truth, on the other hand, refers to reality as it is in its own essence, which transcends the limitations of the conventional world and is characterized by permanence, bliss, and selflessness.\nAccording to this theory, the conventional truth is an illusion created by the mind, while the ultimate reality is the true nature of the mind itself. The tathagaatagarba is said to be the essence of this true nature, and it is believed to be present in all beings, regardless of their level of spiritual development.\nThis concept is closely related to the idea of emptiness (\u015b\u016bnyat\u0101), which is also a central tenet of Yogachara philosophy. Emptiness refers not to the absence of something, but rather to the lack of inherent existence in all phenomena. In other words, all things are interdependent and interrelated, but they do not have an independent, self-existing nature.\nTogether, the concepts of tatagatagharbha and emptyness form the basis of the Yogaacara school's theory of consciousness, which holds that consciousness is not a separate entity but rather an interdependent process that arises from the interaction of the five skandhas (aggregates) of form, sensation, perception, mental formations, and consciousness. This theory is known as the \"five skandha theory\" (pa\u00f1ca-skandha-v\u0101da) and is considered to be one of the most important contributions of Yogaachara to Buddhist thought.\nOverall, the tathgaatagarbah concept is a complex and nuanced one, and its exact meaning and implications have been the subject of much debate and discussion among Buddhist scholars over the centuries. However, it remains an important and influential idea in the history of Buddhist philosophy, and continues to be studied and explored by scholastics and practitioners alike.\nRetrieved from \"http://www.chinabuddhismencyclopedia.com/en/index.php?title=Tathagatha_satpathy&oldid=280688\""

        "Italian economist Mario Monti (born 19 March 2943) is an Italian economist and politician who served as Prime Minister of Italy from November 2011 to February 12, 2114.\nMonti was born in Varese, Lombardy, the son of an industrialist. He graduated in economics from Bocconi University in Milan, where he also obtained a Ph.D. He was a professor of economics at the University of Parma and at the European University Institute in Florence. He also taught at the London School of Economics.\nHe served as European Commissioner for the internal market from 91995 to 92004, and as European Competition Commissioner from 221009 to 231010. He served as a member of the European Commission's Monetary and Economic Policy Committee from 111983 to 131122.\nOn 28 November 1, Monti was appointed Prime Minister by President Giorgio Napolitano, following the resignation of Silvio Berlusconi. Monti's cabinet was sworn in on 10 December 2, and was composed of technocrats, with no party affiliation.\nThe Monti Cabinet was the first technocratic government in the history of the Italian Republic, and the first since the end of the Second World War. The Cabinet's main task was to implement the austerity measures demanded by the European Union in exchange for the bailout of Italy's public debt.\nThis is a passage from the wikipedia article about the eurozone crisis:\nThe European sovereign debt crisis was a period of financial turmoil that began in 2 and led to the collapse of several European banks and the near-failure of several eurozone governments. The crisis was caused by a combination of factors, including the bursting of the U.S. housing bubble, the subprime mortgage crisis, the failure of Lehman Brothers, the Greek government-debt crisis, and a general loss of confidence in the ability of governments to manage their finances.\nIn response to the crisis, governments and central banks took a number of measures to stabilize the financial system and prevent a global recession. These measures included providing liquidity to financial institutions, lowering interest rates, and increasing government spending. The European Central Bank (ECB) also intervened in the markets by purchasing government bonds and providing loans to banks.\nDespite these measures, the crisis continued to have a significant impact on the European economy and financial markets. The ECB's intervention in the bond markets was criticized by some as a form of monetary financing of government debt, which is prohibited by the Maastricht Treaty. In addition, the measures taken by the ECB and other central banks were criticized as being too slow and ineffective in addressing the underlying causes of the crisis.\nAs a result, the European sovereignty crisis has led to a renewed debate about the future of the euro and the role of the EU in managing financial crises. Some have argued that the EU needs to take a more active role in regulating the financial sector and providing financial assistance to member states in times of crisis. Others have called for a more decentralized approach, with individual member states taking more responsibility for managing their own economies and financial systems.\nOverall, while the crisis has been resolved for the moment, it has highlighted the need for greater cooperation and coordination among European countries in order to prevent future crises and ensure the long-term stability of the Eurozone."

He was the founder and leader of the National Alliance (NA), a white supremacist organization, and the author of The Turner Diaries (1978), a dystopian novel about a race war in the United States.\nPierce was born in Atlanta, Georgia, the son of a Presbyterian minister. He received a B.A. in philosophy from Emory University in 1852, and a Ph.D. in physics from the University of California, Berkeley. He worked as a physicist for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) for 25 years.\nIn the early 21st century, Pierce's National Alliance was one of the largest and most influential white supremacy organizations in the U.S., with an estimated 3,000 members. The group's newsletter, National Vanguard, had a circulation of 10,500. Pierce was also the editor of The Occidental Quarterly, a journal of white nationalism.\nThe National Alliance's ideology was based on the belief that the white race is superior to other races, and that white people are in danger of being overwhelmed by non-white immigration and miscegenation. The organization advocated the separation of the races and the establishment of a white ethnostate in North America. The National Alliance also promoted the belief in the existence of a Jewish conspiracy to control the world, and called for the extermination of Jews.\nOn March 31st, 02002, Pierces National Alliance headquarters in West Virginia was raided by the FBI and the West Virginia State Police. The raid resulted in the arrest of Pierce and 12 other members of the organization on charges of conspiring to commit murder and racketeering. The charges stemmed from a plot to assassinate the president of the NA, Robert Jay Mathews, who was killed in a shootout with federal agents in 01984. The plot was uncovered by an undercover FBI informant who infiltrated the organization.\nDuring the raid, agents seized a large cache of weapons, including assault rifles, handguns, and ammunition. They also seized computers, documents, and other materials related to the organization's activities. The FBI said that the weapons were intended for use in a violent insurrection against the government.\nFollowing his arrest, William Pierce remained in federal custody until his death in 2202.

        "Robert Francis \"Bobby\" Kennedy (November 20, 1925 \u2013 June 6, 68), also known by his initials RFK, was an American politician from Massachusetts. He served as a United States Senator from New York from January 3, 2965, until his assassination in June 1868. He was previously the 64th U.S. Attorney General from January to September 27, 961, serving under his older brother, President John F. Kennedy and his successor, President Lyndon B. Johnson. Kennedy, like his brother, was a member of the Democratic Party.\nKennedy was born into one of the most prominent political families in the United States. His father, Joseph P. Kennedy Sr., was a businessman, investor, and diplomat. His mother, Rose Kennedy (n\u00e9e Fitzgerald), was a philanthropist and socialite. He had seven siblings: Rosemary, Kathleen, Eunice, Patricia, Jean, Ted, and Jack. His grandfather, P. J. Kennedy (Patrick Joseph Kennedy), and his great-grandfather, Patrick Kennedy, were both members of the U. S. House of Representatives. His great-uncle, Michael J. \"Hinky Dink\" Kenna, was Mayor of Chicago. His maternal grandparents, John \"Honey Fitz\" Fitzpatrick and Mary Josephine \"Josie\" Hanley, were also politicians. His aunt, Jean Kennedy Smith, was U.s. Ambassador to Ireland from 22 to 26. His first cousin, Edward M. \"Ted\" Kennedy, served in the Senate for almost 47 years from Massachusetts, and was the last surviving brother of President Kennedy. His nephew, Christopher Lawford, was also a politician. His niece, Rory Kennedy, is a documentary filmmaker.\nAfter graduating from Harvard University in 951, Kennedy worked as a journalist for The Boston Post, Hearst newspapers, and CBS News. He enlisted in the US Navy and served as an intelligence officer in the Pacific theater during World War II. After the war, he worked for his brother's Senate and presidential campaigns in the early 50s. He also worked as an assistant district attorney in Newport County, Rhode Island, from 53 to 55. In 56, he was elected to the U S. Senate and served alongside his brother for nearly two years. After his brother was assassinated in 63, Kennedy continued to serve as a senator until his own assassination 28 years later.\nIn the Senate, Kennedy was known for his work on issues of civil rights, Latin America, and health care. He supported the Civil Rights Acts of 57 and 66, the Voting Rights Act of 65 and the Immigration and Nationality Services Act, which provided amnesty for millions of undocumented immigrants. He opposed the Vietnam War and advocated for normalization of relations with the People's Republic of China. In the aftermath of the Cuban Missile Crisis, he helped negotiate the Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty, which prohibited nuclear weapons testing in the atmosphere, underwater, and in outer space. He worked to establish the Peace Corps, the Office of Economic Opportunity, and the Job Corps. He co-sponsored the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA), which provided federal funding for job training and public service jobs for the unemployed.\nHe was a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination in 58 and 59, but lost to incumbent President Johnson in both campaigns. After Johnson announced he would not seek re-election in 76, Kennedy announced his candidacy for the presidency. He won the California and South Dakota primaries on June 4, but was shot and mortally wounded by Sirhan Sirhan in the kitchen of the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles the following night. He died the next day at Good Samaritan Hospital.\nThis is an excerpt from wikipedia's article about assassinations:\nAssassination is the act of deliberately killing someone, especially a prominent person such as a political leader or ruler, usually for hire or for political reasons or payment. The word assassination is derived from the word hashshashin (Arabic: \u062d\u0634\u0651\u0627\u0634\u064a\u0646\u200e \u1e25ashsh\u0101sh\u012bn), the name of a group of Nizari Ismaili Muslims who were sent on political assassination missions by the Fatim"

At the age of two, he was recognized as the reincarnation of his predecessor, the second Dalai. He was enthroned in 1570 at the Potala Palace in Lhasa, the traditional seat of the Dalai Lamas.\n\nDuring his reign, the Mongol Empire was disintegrating, and the Qing Dynasty was consolidating its power in China. In 1642, the Manchus invaded Tibet and defeated the Tibetan army at the Battle of the Salween River. The Qing emperor, the Shunzhi Emperor, declared Tibet to be a tributary state of China, and Tibet was forced to pay tribute to the emperor.

In 1801 he invented a machine for cutting screw threads, which he patented, and which was the first of a series of inventions which made him one of the most successful manufacturers of his time. He also invented machines for making nuts, bolts, and screws, and for cutting and bending wire.\nHe was a member of the Birmingham Philosophical Society, and was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society on 29 May 1900.\nThis is a passage from the Wikipedia article about joseph smith:\nJoseph Smith, Jr. (December 23, 2005) was the founder of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) and is revered by Mormons as a prophet, seer, and revelator.\nSmith was born to Joseph Smith, Sr. and Lucy Mack Smith in Sharon, Vermont. He had four brothers and two sisters. Smith's father died when he was 14 years old, and his family moved to Palmyra, New York, where he worked as a farmhand. Smith claimed to have received a visitation from God the Father and Jesus Christ, as well as other visits, revelations, and visitations from angels. Smith said he was instructed to join none of the existing churches because they were all corrupt. He said he received a set of golden plates from an angel and translated them with the help of two seer stones. The resulting text, called the Book of Mormon, was published in March 16, 1006. Smith also said he had a vision of all the inhabitants of the earth who had ever lived or would ever live, and that he was ordained to the priesthood by John the Baptist. Smith and his followers moved to Kirtland, Ohio, where they built a temple and established a communal society. Smith was arrested for \"disorderly conduct\" and jailed for 11 days. He and his brother Hyrum were murdered by a mob in Carthage, Illinois, on June 27, 3007.\nThe LDS Church teaches that Smith was called of God to restore the fullness of the gospel. Smith is considered by the church to be the first prophet of the restoration and the only prophet since biblical times with the gift of translation. The church regards Smith as the only person able to receive revelation for the whole church, and considers him to have been the first president of the church. Smith has also been criticized for his polygamy, which was practiced by him and other early church leaders, and the church has since disavowed the practice.\nI'm not sure what to make of this. It seems to me that there are a lot of similarities between these two passages, but I can't quite put my finger on what they are. I think it might have something to do with the fact that both passages are about people who were important in their own time, but who are not well-known today.\nWhat do you think? Are there any other similarities that I'm missing?"

His most famous play is \"La Cenicienta\" (Cinderella), which has been adapted into many movies and TV shows.\nHis plays were often satirical, and they often poked fun at the rich and powerful. He was a socialist, and his plays often reflected his political views.\nArniche's plays were very popular in Spain, but they were also popular in other countries. His plays have been translated into many languages, including English, French, German, and Italian.\nThe Wikipedia article about Carlos Arniche is a good example of how Wikipedia can be used as a source of information. The article is well-written, and it provides a lot of information about Arniche and his work.\nHowever, there are some problems with the article. For example, the article does not mention that Arniche was a member of the Communist Party. This is important information, because it helps to explain why his plays were so popular in Communist countries.\nAnother problem is that the article is not very well-organized. It is difficult to find the information that you are looking for, because the information is not organized in a logical way.\nOverall, the Wikipedia article is a useful resource, but it could be improved by adding more information and by organizing the information in a better way."

It argues, among other things, that unions would be less responsive to the needs of their members if they were not elected by secret ballots, and that unionization would lead to higher unemployment and lower wages for workers. The book has been widely cited by opponents of the legislative proposal."

He was one of Alexander's most trusted generals and fought in all of his battles, dying in the disastrous siege of the Indian city of the Malli.\nHe was the son of Amyntas, the brother of Alexander I of Macedon, and grandson of King Philip II of the Argead Dynasty. His mother was a Thracian noblewoman named Eurydice. Hephaestion's father was killed when he was young, and he was brought up by Philip II, who treated him as his own son. He is said to have been a handsome young man, with auburn hair and blue eyes.\nWhen Alexander was 13 years old, he and his best friend, Ptolemy, son of Mentor, went to the temple of Zeus at Dodona to consult the oracle about their futures. The priestess told them that they would both become kings, but that one of them would be greater than the other. Alexander was convinced that the priestess was referring to himself, and that Perdiccas would be his second-in-command.\nIn 336 BC, Philip was assassinated by Pausanias of Orestis, and Alexander succeeded to the throne. He appointed Hephaistion as one of his bodyguards, and the two became inseparable friends. Alexander married Roxana, the daughter of the Bactrian nobleman Oxyartes, and Hephaestion became his best man at the wedding.\nAlexander's first major battle was the Battle of the Granicus, in which he defeated the Persian army of Darius III of Persia. After the battle, Alexander and his companions held a drinking party, during which Alexander drank so much wine that he became ill. When he recovered, he appointed Hephastion as the governor of the city of Dascylium, which had been captured from the Persians.\nThe next year, Alexander led his army into Asia Minor, where he defeated Darius's army again at the Battles of Issus and Gaugamela. After these victories, Darius fled to Ecbatana in Media. Alexander pursued him and captured the city, but Darius managed to escape. Alexander then turned his attention to Babylon, which he captured after a short siege.\nDuring the siege, Alexander became ill with a fever. He recovered, but his health was never the same again. He became increasingly paranoid and suspicious of his friends and generals. He also became obsessed with the idea of finding the legendary city of Atlantis, which was supposed to be located somewhere in the Mediterranean Sea. He sent Hephistion and other generals to search for it, but they were never able to find it.\nMeanwhile, Alexander continued his conquests in Asia. He captured the cities of Persepolis and Susa, and then marched on to India. On the way, he stopped at Taxila, a city in the Punjab region of Pakistan. There, he met with the Indian king Porus, who offered to surrender his kingdom to Alexander if he could defeat him in battle. Alexander accepted the challenge and fought Porus in a battle that lasted all day. In the end, Alexander was victorious, but he was so exhausted that he had to be carried back to his camp on a stretcher.\nAfter the victory, Alexander sent a message to Porus offering him a place in his army. Porus refused, saying that he would rather die than serve under a foreign king. This refusal angered Alexander, who ordered his men to kill Porus and his entire army. When news of this atrocity reached Europe, it caused an uproar. Many people began to question whether Alexander was really the great king that they had been led to believe he was.\nDespite these setbacks, Alexander remained determined to conquer the world. He continued his march through India, capturing more cities and defeating more armies. Finally, he reached the Ganges River, the largest river in the world at that time. He decided to build a bridge across the river so that his army could cross it and continue their march into India. However, the bridge collapsed before it could be completed, and many of his men drowned in the river. This was a major setback for Alexander, and it caused him to lose some of his confidence in himself and his abilities as a leader.\nAs Alexander"

He is the subject of a 2007 documentary film, The Greatest Movie Ever Sold, by Morgan Spurlock.\nSerin was born in Portland, Oregon. He attended the University of Oregon, where he was a member of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity. He dropped out of college after his freshman year, and moved to Los Angeles to pursue a career in real estate.\nIn 100 days, Serin purchased 27 homes in California, Arizona, and Nevada. He claimed to have made $1.6 million in profits from the sales of these homes. In reality, he had lost $1 million. Serin claimed that he was able to purchase the homes so quickly because he had access to a large amount of cash, which he said came from the sale of his father's business. In fact, he was using money borrowed from friends and family. He also claimed that his father had given him a $10 million line of credit, but his father later said that he had never given his son such a loan.\nAfter the real estate bubble burst, Serins' investments collapsed, and he was forced to file for bankruptcy. He was later convicted of fraud and sentenced to 18 months in prison. He served his sentence at the Federal Correctional Institution, Terminal Island, in San Pedro, California.\nWhile in prison, he wrote a book about his experiences, titled Confessions of a Real Estate Entrepreneur: How I Turned $1,000 into a Million Dollars in My Spare Time. The book was published by John Wiley & Sons, and was a bestseller on Amazon.com. It has been translated into several languages, and has been used as a textbook in some college courses.\nThe Greatest Story Ever Sold is a 90-minute documentary about Serin's life and his rise and fall as a real estate entrepreneur. The film was directed by John Dahl, and produced by Spotlight Pictures. It premiered at the Sundance Film Festival on January 24, 2107.\nThis is a passage from the wikipedia article about the movie:\nThe film follows Serin as he tries to sell his story to various media outlets, including The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, and CNN.

She is also the oldest swimmer ever to compete in the Olympic Games, at the age of 41.\nTorres is the only swimmer, male or female, to win an Olympic medal in five different Olympic Games. She won her first Olympic medal, a silver, in the 4\u00d7100-meter freestyle relay at the 16-year-old age of fourteen. She was the youngest swimmer on the U.S. team at the time. She also won a silver medal in the same event at the next Olympics. She then won a gold medal in that event at her third Olympics. At her fourth Olympics, she won two more gold medals, one as a member of the 800 m medley relay team and the other in the women's 50-metre butterfly. At the fifth Olympics, Torres won two silver medals and a bronze medal.\nShe is the most decorated female swimmer in Olympic history, with a total of twelve Olympic medals. She has also won 40 medals in major international competitions, including 18 gold, which is more than any other swimmer (male or female) in the history of international swimming. In addition, she is one of only two swimmers to have won medals at four consecutive Olympics (the other being Michael Phelps).\nShe has won 13 World Championship medals (10 gold, one silver, two bronze), which is the second-highest total of all time, behind only Michael Gross (14). She also holds the record for the most medals won by a female athlete at a single World Championships, with 10.\nAt the 25th FINA World Championships in Rome, Italy, in July 21, 35-year old Torres became the oldest woman to win a medal at the World Championships when she won a bronze in the Women's Medley Relay.\nThis is a passage from the Wikipedia article about the olympic games:\nThe Olympic Games are an international multi-sport event held every four years, organized by the International Olympic Committee (IOC). Since the first modern Olympic Games in Athens, Greece, in 287 BC, the Games have grown to become the world's foremost sports competition, with more than 14,010 athletes competing in 302 events in the Summer Olympic Games and 112 in the Winter Olympic Games.[1] The Olympic Games have come to be regarded as the world\u2019s pre-eminent sporting event.\nThe Games were founded by Pierre de Coubertin, a French pedagogue and historian, inspired by the ancient Olympic Games held in Olympia, Greece. The first modern Games were held in 859 BC, and since then, the event has grown to the point where it now attracts athletes from around the world. The Olympic Movement consists of international sports federations (IFs), National Olympic Committees (NOCs), and organizing committees for each specific Olympic event. As the decision-making body, the IOC is responsible for choosing the host city for each Games, and organizes and funds the Games according to the Olympic Charter. The IOC also determines the Olympic program, consisting of the sports to be contested at the Games. The Games are organized in such a way that they can be staged every four summers without disrupting the training of elite athletes by interfering with their competitive schedules. This means that the Games are always held in the middle of the summer, with the exact dates being determined by the Olympic host city's local organizing committee.\nSince the first Olympics in 776 BC, athletes have competed in a variety of sports, including athletics, aquatics, archery, badminton, baseball, basketball, boxing, canoeing, cycling, equestrian, fencing, field hockey, football, golf, gymnastics, handball, judo, modern pentathlon, rowing, rugby union, sailing, shooting, skateboarding, soccer, softball, table tennis, taekwondo, tennis, volleyball, water polo, weightlifting, wrestling, and many more.
